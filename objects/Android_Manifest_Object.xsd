					<xs:element minOccurs="0" name="uses-permission" type="AndroidManifestObj:UsesPermissionType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The uses-permission field requests a permission that the application must be granted in order for it to operate correctly. Permissions are granted by the user when the application is installed, not while it's running. For more information on permissions, see the Permissions section in the introduction and the separate Security and Permissions document. A list of permissions defined by the base platform can be found at android.Manifest.permission.</xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element minOccurs="0" name="permission" type="AndroidManifestObj:PermissionType">
						<xs:annotation>

						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element minOccurs="0" name="permission-tree" type="AndroidManifestObj:PermissionTreeType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The permission-tree field declares the base name for a tree of permissions. The application takes ownership of all names within the tree. It can dynamically add new permissions to the tree by calling PackageManager.addPermission(). Names within the tree are separated by periods ('.'). For example, if the base name is com.example.project.taxes, permissions like the following might be added:com.example.project.taxes.CALCULATE, com.example.project.taxes.deductions.MAKE_SOME_UP, com.example.project.taxes.deductions.EXAGGERATE     Note that this element does not declare a permission itself, only a namespace in which further permissions can be placed. See the permission element for information on declaring permissions.</xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element minOccurs="0" name="permission-group" type="AndroidManifestObj:PermissionGroupType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The permission-group field declares a name for a logical grouping of related permissions. Individual permission join the group through the permissionGroup element of the permission element. Members of a group are presented together in the user interface. Note that this element does not declare a permission itself, only a category in which permissions can be placed. </xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="0" name="instrumentation" type="AndroidManifestObj:InstrumentationType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The instrumentation field declares an Instrumentation class that enables you to monitor an application's interaction with the system. The Instrumentation object is instantiated before any of the application's components.</xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="0" name="uses-sdk" type="AndroidManifestObj:SDKVersionType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The uses-sdk field lets you express an application's compatibility with one or more versions of the Android platform, by means of an API Level integer. The API Level expressed by an application will be compared to the API Level of a given Android system, which may vary among different Android devices. Despite its name, this element is used to specify the API Level, not the version number of the SDK (software development kit) or Android platform. The API Level is always a single integer. You cannot derive the API Level from its associated Android version number (for example, it is not the same as the major version or the sum of the major and minor versions).</xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="0" name="uses-configuration" type="AndroidManifestObj:ConfigurationType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The uses-configuration field indicates what hardware and software features the application requires. For example, an application might specify that it requires a physical keyboard or a particular navigation device, like a trackball. The specification is used to avoid installing the application on devices where it will not work.</xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="0" name="uses-feature" type="AndroidManifestObj:FeatureType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The uses-feature field declares a single hardware or software feature that is used by the application. The purpose of a uses-feature declaration is to inform any external entity of the set of hardware and software features on which your application depends. The element offers a required element that lets you specify whether your application requires and cannot function without the declared feature, or whether it prefers to have the feature but can function without it. Because feature support can vary across Android devices, the uses-feature element serves an important role in letting an application describe the device-variable features that it uses. The set of available features that your application declares corresponds to the set of feature constants made available by the Android PackageManager, which are listed for convenience in the Features Reference tables at the bottom of this document. You must specify each feature in a separate uses-feature element, so if your application requires multiple features, it would declare multiple uses-feature elements. In general, you should always make sure to declare uses-feature elements for all of the features that your application requires. Declared uses-feature elements are informational only, meaning that the Android system itself does not check for matching feature support on the device before installing an application. However, other services (such as Google Play) or applications may check your application's uses-feature declarations as part of handling or interacting with your application. For this reason, it's very important that you declare all of the features (from the list below) that your application uses. For some features, there may exist a specific element that allows you to define a version of the feature, such as the version of Open GL used (declared with glEsVersion). Other features that either do or do not exist for a device, such as a camera, are declared using the name element. Although the uses-feature element is only activated for devices running API Level 4 or higher, it is recommended to include these elements for all applications, even if the minSdkVersion is "3" or lower. Devices running older versions of the platform will simply ignore the element.</xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="0" name="supports-screens" type="AndroidManifestObj:ScreenSupportType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The supports-screens field lets you specify the screen sizes your application supports and enable screen compatibility mode for screens larger than what your application supports. It's important that you always use this element in your application to specify the screen sizes your application supports. An application "supports" a given screen size if it resizes properly to fill the entire screen. Normal resizing applied by the system works well for most applications and you don't have to do any extra work to make your application work on screens larger than a handset device. However, it's often important that you optimize your application's UI for different screen sizes by providing alternative layout resources. For instance, you might want to modify the layout of an activity when it is on a tablet compared to when running on a handset device. However, if your application does not work well when resized to fit different screen sizes, you can use the elements of the supports-screens element to control whether your application should be distributed to smaller screens or have its UI scaled up ("zoomed") to fit larger screens using the system's screen compatibility mode. When you have not designed for larger screen sizes and the normal resizing does not achieve the appropriate results, screen compatibility mode will scale your UI by emulating a normal size screen and medium density, then zooming in so that it fills the entire screen. Beware that this causes pixelation and blurring of your UI, so it's better if you optimize your UI for large screens.</xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element maxOccurs="1" minOccurs="0" name="compatible-screens" type="AndroidManifestObj:CompatibleScreensType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The compatible-screens field specifies each screen configuration with which the application is compatible. Only one instance of the compatible-screens element is allowed in the manifest, but it can contain multiple screen elements. Each screen element specifies a specific screen size-density combination with which the application is compatible. The Android system does not read the compatible-screens manifest element (neither at install-time nor at runtime). This element is informational only and may be used by external services (such as Google Play) to better understand the application's compatibility with specific screen configurations and enable filtering for users. Any screen configuration that is not declared in this element is a screen with which the application is not compatible. Thus, external services (such as Google Play) should not provide the application to devices with such screens.</xs:documentation>
						</xs:annotation>
					</xs:element>
					<xs:element name="supports-gl-texture" minOccurs="0" type="AndroidManifestObj:GLTextureType">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The supports-gl-texture field declares a single GL texture compression format that is supported by the application. An application "supports" a GL texture compression format if it is capable of providing texture assets that are compressed in that format, once the application is installed on a device. The application can provide the compressed assets locally, from inside the .apk, or it can download them from a server at runtime. Each supports-gl-texture element declares exactly one supported texture compression format, specified as the value of a android:name element. If your application supports multiple texture compression formats, you can declare multiple supports-gl-texture elements. Declared supports-gl-texture elements are informational, meaning that the Android system itself does not examine the elements at install time to ensure matching support on the device. However, other services (such as Google Play) or applications can check your application's supports-gl-texture declarations as part of handling or interacting with your application. For this reason, it's very important that you declare all of the texture compression formats (from the list below) that your application is capable of supporting. Applications and devices typically declare their supported GL texture compression formats using the same set of well-known strings, as listed below. The set of format strings may grow over time, as needed, and since the values are strings, applications are free to declare other formats as needed.</xs:documentation>

Many of these elements (such as icon, label, permission, process, taskAffinity, and allowTaskReparenting) set default values for corresponding elements of the component elements. Others (such as debuggable, enabled, description, and allowClearUserData) set values for the application as a whole and cannot be overridden by the components.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>The backupAgent field specifies the name of the class that implement's the application's backup agent, a subclass of BackupAgent. The element value should be a fully qualified class name (such as, "com.example.project.MyBackupAgent"). However, as a shorthand, if the first character of the name is a period (for example, ".MyBackupAgent"), it is appended to the package name specified in the manifest element.</xs:documentation>
				</xs:annotation>

			<xs:element name="banner" type="cyboxCommon:StringObjectPropertyType" minOccurs="0">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The banner field specifies a drawable resource providing an extended graphical banner for its associated item. Use with the application tag to supply a default banner for all application activities, or with the activity tag to supply a banner for a specific activity. The system uses the banner to represent an app in the Android TV home screen. Since the banner is displayed only in the home screen, it should only be specified by applications with an activity that handles the CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER intent. This element must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing the image (for example "@drawable/banner"). There is no default banner.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>The label field specifies a user-readable label for the application as a whole, and a default label for each of the application's components. See the individual label elements for activity, activity-alias, service, receiver, and provider elements. The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized like other strings in the user interface. However, as a convenience while you're developing the application, it can also be set as a raw string.</xs:documentation>

				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="name" type="cyboxCommon:StringObjectPropertyType" minOccurs="0">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The name field specifies the fully qualified name of an Application subclass implemented for the application. When the application process is started, this class is instantiated before any of the application's components. The subclass is optional; most applications won't need one. In the absence of a subclass, Android uses an instance of the base Application class.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:element name="permission" type="cyboxCommon:StringObjectPropertyType" minOccurs="0">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The permission field specifies the name of a permission that clients must have in order to interact with the application. This element is a convenient way to set a permission that applies to all of the application's components. It can be overwritten by setting the permission elements of individual components.</xs:documentation>
				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="process" type="cyboxCommon:StringObjectPropertyType" minOccurs="0">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The process field specifies the name of a process where all components of the application should run. Each component can override this default by setting its own process element. By default, Android creates a process for an application when the first of its components needs to run. All components then run in that process. The name of the default process matches the package name set by the manifest element. By setting this element to a process name that's shared with another application, you can arrange for components of both applications to run in the same process — but only if the two applications also share a user ID and be signed with the same certificate. If the name assigned to this element begins with a colon (':'), a new process, private to the application, is created when it's needed. If the process name begins with a lowercase character, a global process of that name is created. A global process can be shared with other applications, reducing resource usage.</xs:documentation>

If your app requires an Account, the value for this element must correspond to the account authenticator type used by your app (as defined by AuthenticatorDescription), such as "com.google". The default value is null and indicates that the application can work without any accounts. Because restricted profiles currently cannot add accounts, specifying this element makes your app unavailable from a restricted profile unless you also declare android:restrictedAccountType with the same value.</xs:documentation>
				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="restrictedAccountType" type="cyboxCommon:StringObjectPropertyType" minOccurs="0">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The restrictedAccountType field specifies the account type required by this application and indicates that restricted profiles are allowed to access such accounts that belong to the owner user. If your app requires an Account and restricted profiles are allowed to access the primary user's accounts, the value for this element must correspond to the account authenticator type used by your app (as defined by AuthenticatorDescription), such as "com.google". The default value is null and indicates that the application can work without any accounts.</xs:documentation>
				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="taskAffinity" type="cyboxCommon:StringObjectPropertyType" minOccurs="0">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The taskAffinity field specifies an affinity name that applies to all activities within the application, except for those that set a different affinity with their own taskAffinity elements. See that element for more information. By default, all activities within an application share the same affinity. The name of that affinity is the same as the package name set by the manifest element.</xs:documentation>
				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="theme" type="cyboxCommon:StringObjectPropertyType" minOccurs="0">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The theme field specifies a reference to a style resource defining a default theme for all activities in the application. Individual activities can override the default by setting their own theme elements. For more information, see the Styles and Themes developer guide.</xs:documentation>
				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>

		</xs:sequence>
		<xs:attribute name="allowTaskReparenting" type="xs:boolean">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>The allowTaskReporting field specifies whether or not activities that the application defines can move from the task that started them to the task they have an affinity for when that task is next brought to the front — "true" if they can move, and "false" if they must remain with the task where they started. The default value is "false". The activity element has its own allowTaskReparenting element that can override the value set here. See that element for more information.</xs:documentation>
			</xs:annotation>
		</xs:attribute>
		<xs:attribute name="allowBackup" type="xs:boolean">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>The allowBackup field specifies whether to allow the application to participate in the backup and restore infrastructure. If this element is set to false, no backup or restore of the application will ever be performed, even by a full-system backup that would otherwise cause all application data to be saved via adb. The default value of this element is true.</xs:documentation>
			</xs:annotation>
		</xs:attribute>
		<xs:attribute name="debuggable" type="xs:boolean">
			<xs:annotation>

			</xs:annotation>
		</xs:attribute>
		<xs:attribute name="enabled" type="xs:boolean">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>The enabled field specifies whether or not the Android system can instantiate components of the application — "true" if it can, and "false" if not. If the value is "true", each component's enabled element determines whether that component is enabled or not. If the value is "false", it overrides the component-specific values; all components are disabled.</xs:documentation>

		<xs:attribute name="hasCode" type="xs:boolean">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>The hasCode field specifies whether or not the application contains any code — "true" if it does, and "false" if not. When the value is "false", the system does not try to load any application code when launching components. The default value is "true".

			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>The hardwareAccelerated field specifies whether or not hardware-accelerated rendering should be enabled for all activities and views in this application — "true" if it should be enabled, and "false" if not. The default value is "true" if you've set either minSdkVersion or targetSdkVersion to "14" or higher; otherwise, it's "false". Starting from Android 3.0 (API level 11), a hardware-accelerated OpenGL renderer is available to applications, to improve performance for many common 2D graphics operations. When the hardware-accelerated renderer is enabled, most operations in Canvas, Paint, Xfermode, ColorFilter, Shader, and Camera are accelerated. This results in smoother animations, smoother scrolling, and improved responsiveness overall, even for applications that do not explicitly make use the framework's OpenGL libraries. Note that not all of the OpenGL 2D operations are accelerated. If you enable the hardware-accelerated renderer, test your application to ensure that it can make use of the renderer without errors.</xs:documentation>

Single-package restore operations will never cause the application to be shut down. Full-system restore operations typically only occur once, when the phone is first set up. Third-party applications will not normally need to use this element.

It only applies to the first application loaded into a process; if you're using a shared user ID to allow multiple applications to use a process, they all must use this option consistently or they will have unpredictable results. Most apps should not need this and should instead focus on reducing their overall memory usage for improved performance.

The affinity determines two things — the task that the activity is re-parented to (see the allowTaskReparenting element) and the task that will house the activity when it is launched with the FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag. By default, all activities in an application have the same affinity. You can set this element to group them differently, and even place activities defined in different applications within the same task. To specify that the activity does not have an affinity for any task, set it to an empty string.

The adjustment made to the activity's main window — whether it is resized smaller to make room for the soft keyboard or whether its contents pan to make the current focus visible when part of the window is covered by the soft keyboard. The setting must be one of the values listed in the following table, or a combination of one "state..." value plus one "adjust..." value.

		<xs:attribute name="allowTaskReparenting" type="xs:boolean">
			<xs:annotation>
				<xs:documentation>The allowTaskReparenting field specifies whether or not the activity can move from the task that started it to the task it has an affinity for when that task is next brought to the front — "true" if it can move, and "false" if it must remain with the task where it started. If this element is not set, the value set by the corresponding allowTaskReparenting element of the application element applies to the activity. The default value is "false". Normally when an activity is started, it's associated with the task of the activity that started it and it stays there for its entire lifetime. You can use this element to force it to be re-parented to the task it has an affinity for when its current task is no longer displayed. Typically, it's used to cause the activities of an application to move to the main task associated with that application. For example, if an e-mail message contains a link to a web page, clicking the link brings up an activity that can display the page. That activity is defined by the browser application, but is launched as part of the e-mail task. If it's reparented to the browser task, it will be shown when the browser next comes to the front, and will be absent when the e-mail task again comes forward. The affinity of an activity is defined by the taskAffinity element. The affinity of a task is determined by reading the affinity of its root activity. Therefore, by definition, a root activity is always in a task with the same affinity. Since activities with "singleTask" or "singleInstance" launch modes can only be at the root of a task, re-parenting is limited to the "standard" and "singleTop" modes. (See also the launchMode element.)</xs:documentation>

The default value is "false". This element is meaningful only for the root activity of a task; it's ignored for all other activities. Normally, the system clears a task (removes all activities from the stack above the root activity) in certain situations when the user re-selects that task from the home screen. Typically, this is done if the user hasn't visited the task for a certain amount of time, such as 30 minutes. However, when this element is "true", users will always return to the task in its last state, regardless of how they get there. This is useful, for example, in an application like the web browser where there is a lot of state (such as multiple open tabs) that users would not like to lose.</xs:documentation>

				<xs:documentation>The clearTaskOnLaunch field specifies whether or not all activities will be removed from the task, except for the root activity, whenever it is re-launched from the home screen — "true" if the task is always stripped down to its root activity, and "false" if not. The default value is "false". This element is meaningful only for activities that start a new task (the root activity); it's ignored for all other activities in the task. When the value is "true", every time users start the task again, they are brought to its root activity regardless of what they were last doing in the task and regardless of whether they used the Back or Home button to leave it. When the value is "false", the task may be cleared of activities in some situations (see the alwaysRetainTaskState element), but not always. Suppose, for example, that someone launches activity P from the home screen, and from there goes to activity Q. The user next presses Home, and then returns to activity P. Normally, the user would see activity Q, since that is what they were last doing in P's task. However, if P set this flag to "true", all of the activities on top of it (Q in this case) were removed when the user pressed Home and the task went to the background. So the user sees only P when returning to the task. If this element and allowTaskReparenting are both "true", any activities that can be re-parented are moved to the task they share an affinity with; the remaining activities are then dropped, as described above.</xs:documentation>

If "false", the activity can be launched only by components of the same application or applications with the same user ID. The default value depends on whether the activity contains intent filters. The absence of any filters means that the activity can be invoked only by specifying its exact class name. This implies that the activity is intended only for application-internal use (since others would not know the class name). So in this case, the default value is "false". On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the activity is intended for external use, so the default value is "true". This element is not the only way to limit an activity's exposure to other applications. You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that can invoke the activity (see the permission element).</xs:documentation>

				<xs:documentation>The stateNotNeeded field specifies whether or not the activity can be killed and successfully restarted without having saved its state — "true" if it can be restarted without reference to its previous state, and "false" if its previous state is required. The default value is "false". Normally, before an activity is temporarily shut down to save resources, its onSaveInstanceState() method is called. This method stores the current state of the activity in a Bundle object, which is then passed to onCreate() when the activity is restarted. If this element is set to "true", onSaveInstanceState() may not be called and onCreate() will be passed null instead of the Bundle — just as it was when the activity started for the first time. A "true" setting ensures that the activity can be restarted in the absence of retained state. For example, the activity that displays the home screen uses this setting to make sure that it does not get removed if it crashes for some reason.</xs:documentation>

This element has meaning for both activities and broadcast receivers: It provides information about how able an activity is to respond to an intent that matches the filter, relative to other activities that could also respond to the intent. When an intent could be handled by multiple activities with different priorities, Android will consider only those with higher priority values as potential targets for the intent. It controls the order in which broadcast receivers are executed to receive broadcast messages. Those with higher priority values are called before those with lower values. (The order applies only to synchronous messages; it's ignored for asynchronous messages.) Use this element only if you really need to impose a specific order in which the broadcasts are received, or want to force Android to prefer one activity over others. The value must be an integer, such as "100". Higher numbers have a higher priority. The default value is 0. The value must be greater than -1000 and less than 1000.</xs:documentation>

All content providers in your application must be defined in a provider field in the manifest file; otherwise, the system is unaware of them and doesn't run them. You only declare content providers that are part of your application. Content providers in other applications that you use in your application should not be declared. The Android system stores references to content providers according to an authority string, part of the provider's content URI. For example, suppose you want to access a content provider that stores information about health care professionals. To do this, you call the method ContentResolver.query(), which among other arguments takes a URI that identifies the provider: content://com.example.project.healthcareprovider/nurses/rn The content: scheme identifies the URI as a content URI pointing to an Android content provider. The authority com.example.project.healthcareprovider identifies the provider itself; the Android system looks up the authority in its list of known providers and their authorities. The substring nurses/rn is a path, which the content provider can use to identify subsets of the provider data. Notice that when you define your provider in the provider field, you don't include the scheme or the path in the android:name argument, only the authority.</xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The targetSdkVersion field specifies an integer designating the API Level that the application targets. If not set, the default value equals that given to minSdkVersion. This element informs the system that you have tested against the target version and the system should not enable any compatibility behaviors to maintain your app's forward-compatibility with the target version. The application is still able to run on older versions (down to minSdkVersion). As Android evolves with each new version, some behaviors and even appearances might change. However, if the API level of the platform is higher than the version declared by your app's targetSdkVersion, the system may enable compatibility behaviors to ensure that your app continues to work the way you expect. You can disable such compatibility behaviors by specifying targetSdkVersion to match the API level of the platform on which it's running. For example, setting this value to "11" or higher allows the system to apply a new default theme (Holo) to your app when running on Android 3.0 or higher and also disables screen compatibility mode when running on larger screens (because support for API level 11 implicitly supports larger screens). There are many compatibility behaviors that the system may enable based on the value you set for this element. Several of these behaviors are described by the corresponding platform versions in the Build.VERSION_CODES reference. To maintain your application along with each Android release, you should increase the value of this element to match the latest API level, then thoroughly test your application on the corresponding platform version.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:element name="maxSdkVersion" type="cyboxCommon:IntegerObjectPropertyType" minOccurs="0">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The maxSdkVersion field specifies an integer designating the maximum API Level on which the application is designed to run. In Android 1.5, 1.6, 2.0, and 2.0.1, the system checks the value of this element when installing an application and when re-validating the application after a system update. In either case, if the application's maxSdkVersion element is lower than the API Level used by the system itself, then the system will not allow the application to be installed. In the case of re-validation after system update, this effectively removes your application from the device. To illustrate how this element can affect your application after system updates, consider the following example: An application declaring maxSdkVersion="5" in its manifest is published on Google Play. A user whose device is running Android 1.6 (API Level 4) downloads and installs the app. After a few weeks, the user receives an over-the-air system update to Android 2.0 (API Level 5). After the update is installed, the system checks the application's maxSdkVersion and successfully re-validates it. The application functions as normal. However, some time later, the device receives another system update, this time to Android 2.0.1 (API Level 6). After the update, the system can no longer re-validate the application because the system's own API Level (6) is now higher than the maximum supported by the application (5). The system prevents the application from being visible to the user, in effect removing it from the device. Future versions of Android (beyond Android 2.0.1) will no longer check or enforce the maxSdkVersion element during installation or re-validation. Google Play will continue to use the element as a filter, however, when presenting users with applications available for download.</xs:documentation>

For example, to specify OpenGL ES version 2.0, you would set the value as "0x00020000", or to specify OpenGL ES 3.0, you would set the value as "0x00030000". An application should specify at most one android:glEsVersion element in its manifest. If it specifies more than one, the android:glEsVersion with the numerically highest value is used and any other values are ignored. If an application does not specify an android:glEsVersion element, then it is assumed that the application requires only OpenGL ES 1.0, which is supported by all Android-powered devices. An application can assume that if a platform supports a given OpenGL ES version, it also supports all numerically lower OpenGL ES versions. Therefore, an application that requires both OpenGL ES 1.0 and OpenGL ES 2.0 must specify that it requires OpenGL ES 2.0. An application that can work with any of several OpenGL ES versions should only specify the numerically lowest version of OpenGL ES that it requires. (It can check at run-time whether a higher level of OpenGL ES is available.)</xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The requiresSmallestWidthDp field specifies the minimum smallestWidth required. The smallestWidth is the shortest dimension of the screen space (in dp units) that must be available to your application UI—that is, the shortest of the available screen's two dimensions. So, in order for a device to be considered compatible with your application, the device's smallestWidth must be equal to or greater than this value. (Usually, the value you supply for this is the "smallest width" that your layout supports, regardless of the screen's current orientation.) For example, a typical handset screen has a smallestWidth of 320dp, a 7" tablet has a smallestWidth of 600dp, and a 10" tablet has a smallestWidth of 720dp. These values are generally the smallestWidth because they are the shortest dimension of the screen's available space. The size against which your value is compared takes into account screen decorations and system UI. For example, if the device has some persistent UI elements on the display, the system declares the device's smallestWidth as one that is smaller than the actual screen size, accounting for these UI elements because those are screen pixels not available for your UI. Thus, the value you use should be the minimum width required by your layout, regardless of the screen's current orientation. If your application properly resizes for smaller screen sizes (down to the small size or a minimum width of 320dp), you do not need to use this element. Otherwise, you should use a value for this element that matches the smallest value used by your application for the smallest screen width qualifier</xs:documentation>

By default, screen compatibility mode is disabled and your layout is resized to fit the screen as usual, but a button is available in the system bar that allows the user to toggle screen compatibility mode on and off.
