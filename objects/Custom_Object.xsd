			<short_description>The following specifies the fields and types that compose this defined CybOX Object type. Each defined object is an extension of the abstract ObjectPropertiesType, defined in CybOX Common. For more information on this extension mechanism, please see the CybOX Specification. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. </short_description>

The custom_name field should use the same namespace as used in the Object and Observable id fields for this author. Two Objects should only have the same custom_name value if they are written by the same author (i.e., their namespace is the same) and they are characterizing the same type of Object. Note that this does not necessarily mean that two such Object instances will both have identical properties in every case.</xs:documentation>
