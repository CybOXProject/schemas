# CybOX 

International in scope and free for public use,  Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX) is a standardized 
schema for the specification, capture, characterization and communication of events or stateful properties 
that are observable in the operational domain. A wide variety of high-level cyber security use cases rely 
on such information including: event management/logging, malware characterization, intrusion detection, 
incident response/management, attack pattern characterization, etc. CybOX provides a common mechanism 
(structure and content) for addressing cyber observables across and among this full range of use cases 
improving consistency, efficiency, interoperability and overall situational awareness.

Please visit the [CybOX website](https://cyboxproject.github.io/) for more information about the CybOX Language.
