The PlatformSpecificationType, defined in the CybOX common schema, provides a way to provide a prose description of a platform as well as any number of platform identification values. If one wishes to provide a more structured description of a platform, they can define types that extend PlatformSpecificationType. These types would be indicated using an xsi:Type attribute in the relevant element in CybOX content. This directory provides CybOX default extensions to PlatformSpecificationType to support structured description of platforms.
